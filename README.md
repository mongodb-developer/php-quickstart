# Getting Started with MongoDB and PHP

This is  MongoDB PHP quick start. It was written in conjunction with this [article]([https://developer.mongodb.com/quickstart/php-quickstart](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/php/php-setup/)). 

## Status as of February 24, 2021

Under development... incomplete. Stay tuned.

## Prerequisites

   You'll need the following installed on your computer to follow along with this tutorial:

   -  MacOS Catalina or Later - You can run PHP on earlier versions but I'll be keeping to MacOS for this tutorial.
   -  [Homebrew Package Manager](https://brew.sh/) - The missing package manager for MacOS.
   -  [PECL](https://pecl.php.net/) - The repository for PHP Extensions.
   -  A code editor of your choice. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

   This `repo <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/php-quickstart>`__ and the associated article are decidedly macOS focused. PHP is definitely supported across a number of platforms however, I am only currently focusing on macOS. Should there be great interest in expanding the platform coverage, I'll consider cover those.
